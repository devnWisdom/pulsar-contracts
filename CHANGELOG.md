# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning Policy

Versions follow **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** semantics:

| Increment | When to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking ABI change — any change to public function signatures, removed functions, or changed `#[contracttype]` layouts that would break existing callers or stored data. |
| **MINOR** | Backwards-compatible new functionality — new public functions, new optional parameters, new event topics, or new storage keys that do not affect existing callers. |
| **PATCH** | Backwards-compatible bug fixes, documentation updates, internal refactors, or dependency bumps that do not change the public ABI. |

### Release process

1. Update the version in `contracts/payment-processing-contract/Cargo.toml`.
2. Add a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section to this file describing all changes.
3. Commit with message `chore(release): bump version to x.y.z`.
4. Push the commit and open a pull request.
5. Once merged, CI automatically creates a GitHub Release and tags the commit
   `v<x.y.z>` (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
